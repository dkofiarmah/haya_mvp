# Dashboard Routes on Vercel: Fixing Client Reference Manifest Issues

This document explains how to fix the common "ENOENT: no such file or directory" error for client reference manifest files when deploying Next.js apps with dashboard routes to Vercel.

## The Issue

When deploying a Next.js app with a route like `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` to Vercel, you might encounter this error:

```
Traced Next.js server files in: 91.954ms
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path1/.next/server/app/(dashboard)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'
```

This happens because Vercel's file tracing mechanism sometimes fails to properly identify and include client component references for routes with parentheses in their names.

## Our Solution

We've implemented multiple fixes to ensure reliable deployments:

1. **Placeholder Manifest File**: We create a placeholder `page_client-reference-manifest.js` file in the dashboard route
2. **Client Component Wrapper**: We added a `_client-components.tsx` file that explicitly imports and re-exports client components
3. **Post-Build Fix Script**: After the build, we ensure the manifest file exists in the correct location
4. **Enhanced Next.js Config**: We've modified the webpack configuration to better handle client references

## Quick Fix

If you're encountering this issue right now, the fastest solution is:

1. Run this command to fix missing client reference manifests:

```bash
# Create the directory first if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .next/server/app/\(dashboard\)

# Create a placeholder client reference manifest
cat > .next/server/app/\(dashboard\)/page_client-reference-manifest.js << 'EOL'
// Automatically generated client-reference-manifest
globalThis.__RSC_MANIFEST = {
  ssrModuleMapping: {},
  edgeSSRModuleMapping: {},
  clientModules: {},
  entryCSSFiles: {}
};
EOL

echo "âœ… Created client reference manifest for dashboard route"
```

2. Update your `vercel.json` to include:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "bash ./scripts/prepare-vercel-deploy.sh && bash ./scripts/vercel-build.sh",
  "installCommand": "bash ./scripts/vercel-install.sh"
}
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure:

1. Run `bash ./scripts/prepare-vercel-deploy.sh` to set up the necessary files
2. Run a clean build with `rm -rf .next && npm run build`
3. Run `bash ./scripts/fix-client-manifests.sh` to ensure all manifests are in place
4. Verify the build completes successfully
5. Deploy to Vercel with `vercel --prod`

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify that `outputFileTracing: false` is set in `next.config.mjs`
3. Try adding the problematic route to `.vercel/output/config.json` explicitly
4. Consider temporarily simplifying the dashboard page to isolate the issue
