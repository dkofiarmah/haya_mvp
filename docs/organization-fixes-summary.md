# Organization and Onboarding Flow Fixes

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive fix for the onboarding form submission process that addresses the RLS infinite recursion issues and prevents duplicate organization creation:

1. **Database Function Improvements**:
   - Created `get_organization_for_user` to safely retrieve a user's organization ID
   - Fixed `get_user_organizations_safe` to prevent RLS recursion
   - Added service role bypass for `user_profiles` table

2. **Organization Retrieval Strategy**:
   - Created a dedicated helper function `getUserOrganizationId` that:
     - First checks localStorage for organization ID from signup
     - Falls back to the secure database function if needed

3. **Onboarding Form Updates**:
   - Removed redundant organization creation code
   - Implemented a streamlined submission function
   - Added proper error handling and localStorage cleanup

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated organization permission fixes documentation
   - Added detailed information for developers

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the complete signup and onboarding flow with new users
   - Verify that no infinite recursion errors occur
   - Confirm that the user profile is properly updated

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Add additional logging to track organization creation events
   - Monitor database logs for any potential recursion issues
   - Track performance of organization lookup operations

3. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Consider adding caching for organization IDs to improve performance
   - Implement proper error recovery for edge cases
   - Create a dashboard for managing organization access

## Important Notes

1. Organizations should **only** be created during signup in `register/page.tsx`
2. Always use the `getUserOrganizationId` helper function to look up a user's organization
3. The `get_organization_for_user` database function should be used as the source of truth

With these changes, users should no longer experience 500 Internal Server Errors during onboarding, and the organization data should be properly maintained throughout the application.
