### 🌐 Endpoints (Sample)
- `POST /auth/login` — Clerk token verification
- `POST /experiences/` — Create new destination/experience
- `GET /itinerary/generate` — Generate trip from preferences
- `POST /bookings/confirm` — Book selected activities
- `POST /message/send` — Send WhatsApp/email/tweet

## 🧱 Supabase Schema (PostgreSQL)

### 🎯 Tenancy Core
```sql
organizations (id, name, contact_email, phone, stripe_id)
users (id, org_id, name, email, phone, role)
```

### 🧳 Business Modules
```sql
experiences (id, org_id, name, description, location, tags[], images[], vector_embedding)
tours (id, org_id, title, itinerary_json, status, pricing, created_at)
bookings (id, tour_id, item_type, resource_id, status, cost, confirmation_code)
accommodations (id, org_id, name, type, contact, images[], pricing)
customers (id, org_id, name, email, phone, preferences, metadata)
messages (id, org_id, channel, customer_id, direction, content, response, timestamp)
payments (id, customer_id, amount, status, method, invoice_url)
```

### 📦 AI Metadata
```sql
agents (id, org_id, name, type, state, memory_json)
agent_logs (id, agent_id, event, details, created_at)
models_config (org_id, agent_type, preferred_llm)
```

✅ Add RLS (Row Level Security) for all tables scoped to `org_id`
